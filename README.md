## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**YukaMTakagi/YukaMTakagi** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- âœˆ Iâ€™m currently working as a Production IT Engineer for Lufthansa Technik Portugal.
- ğŸ’¬ Iâ€™m currently learning more about github.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I still play Pokemon Go.
